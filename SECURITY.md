## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a potential security threat, vulnerability or exploit in Typeahead-standalone
or one of its upstream dependencies, please DON’T create a pull-request, DON’T
file an issue on GitHub, DON’T mention it on Discord and DON’T create a forum thread.

Do reach out to the team via the contact form at https://digitalfortress.tech/contact/
will investigate and work with you to triage this issue and help you to report it
if appropriate. At the current time we do not have the financial ability to reward
bounties, but in extreme cases, we will, at our discretion, consider a reward.

## Security Audit

You can apply to book the team’s security experts to perform a Security Audit
for your project. Contact us to find out more about how to acquire, validate and publish
an official timestamped and version-locked audit badge.

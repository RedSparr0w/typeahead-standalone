The film's stunt coordinator discusses Jackman's commitment to bulking up-drinking a dozen egg whites a day and going on an intense fitness regime-and director Gavin Hood explains Wolverine's degree of self-loathing about his own nature. We also see some of the design work that went into the film, including the sculpting of young Logan's bone claws and the re-invention of the adamantium tank. Jackman comes off personable as always, and it's clear that he really loves this role.",
